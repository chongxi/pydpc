    "easily downloaded and modified.\n",

    "As before, I'll use a **pairwise distance** function.  This will take an array representing\n",
    "``M`` points in ``N`` dimensions, and return the ``M x M`` matrix of pairwise distances.\n",
    "This is a nice test function for a few reasons.  First of all, it's a very clean and\n",
